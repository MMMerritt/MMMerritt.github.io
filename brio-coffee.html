              <h2>the challenge</h2>

              <p>Artisan coffee roasting has transformed coffee into an art over the past few
                  decades and is growing in popularity as consumers are noticing its
                  attention to quality, flavor, and sustainability. Brio Coffee is a newcomer to
                  the Houston coffee scene and seeks to sell their coffee bean varieties to
                  local coffee shops, farmers markets, and online.</p>

              <p>They need a brand that reflects their values, and that appeals to creatives
                  and the ethically-minded. They also need a homepage to showcase their
                  coffee products and vision.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="solution">

              <img src="images/brio/purple-mug.png" alt="coffee mug" class="illustration-mug">

              <h2>the solution</h2>

              <p>In order to create Brio’s branding and website, I needed to understand the
                  coffee roasting market, the consumers, and the goals that Brio hoped to
                  achieve through their brand. This research helped me construct a brand
                  identity, that is conveyed through the company’s products and homepage.
                  I developed a responsive site that showcases Brio’s coffee bags and
                  reflects their passion for coffee and for life.</p>

          </div>


          <div class="discovery">

                <img src="images/brio/discover.png" alt="magnifying glass" class="illustration-discover">

                <h2>discovery</h2>
                <p>Before I could begin brainstorming the brand identity, I needed to learn
                    more about Brio as a company, their products, their audience, and the
                    coffee market.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="company">

              <h3>the company</h3>
              <p>Brio Coffee has dedicated the necessary
                time and effort towards understanding the
                science behind the roasting process,
                working with artisan growers for high-
                quality raw beans, and crafting the flavors.
                I knew that their brand should reflect this
                dedication and attention to detail.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="products">

              <h3>the products</h3>
              <p>Currently, Brio offers three varieties of
                coffee roasts, from Brazil, Kenya, and Peru.
                Their coffee beans are Fair Trade and
                Single Origin, and Brio wants these
                attributes showcased.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="audience">

              <h3>the audience</h3>
              <p>Brio’s average consumer could be a coffee
                aficionado or someone who is just trying
                coffee for the first time, but ideally, he/she
                appreciates good quality coffee that is
                made with care.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="competitors">

              <h3>the competitors</h3>
              <p>Brio’s competitors range from large coffee
                chains such as Starbucks or Stumptown to
                smaller local coffee roasters such as Java
                Pura or Boomtown Coffee. I focused more
                on these local companies to discover how
                they market themselves to the Houston area.</p>

              <h4>competitors' weaknesses:</h4>

                <li>packaging that lacks flavor description</li>
                <li>in this day and age, not caring about being fair trade</li>
                <li>if the coffee beans are fair trade, there is no indication on the packaging, so it is hard for the consumer to trust the company</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="opportunities">

              <h4>opportunities for improvement:</h4>

                <li>honesty and transparency on how the coffee beans are sourced and processed</li>

              <p class="statement">With this research and a better understanding of Brio as a
                company, I helped establish their Mission, Vision, and Values, which would give
                direction for the branding.</p>

              <div class="brand-outline">
                <h3>mission:</h3>

                <p>To encourage respectful, transparent, and fair partnerships with farmers.

          <div class="user-stories">

              <h2>user stories</h2>

              <p>Now that the company’s mission was established, I focused on the user’s mission and
                wrote out user stories that would help with branding and with wireframes. I knew that
                eventually, we wanted to add more features to Brio’s site, but first, the goal is to showcase
                Brio and its product to the world. I created the MVP based on these user stories:</p>

            <p class="quote italic-text">As a user, I want to…</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold-text">view available coffee roasts</span> to see my options.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-text">know the flavor and origin</span> of each coffee roast.</li>

              <h3>initial concepts &amp; goals</h3>

              <p>Establishing the mission, vision, and values was a vital
                step in creating the brand’s personality, positioning,
                and identity. I sketched out mind-maps and word
                associations to brainstorm the qualities Brio hopes to
                portray, and potential names.</p>
              <p>A lot of coffee brands promote their coffee as being
                super energizing lightning bolts of energy. However,
                the goal with Brio’s branding is to portray coffee as a
                happy, comforting ritual that brings vitality. I wanted
                them to come across as friendly and creative.</p>

            </div>

              <img src="images/brio/coffee-mindmap.png" alt="Mind Map" class="coffee-mindmap">

            <div class="logo-design">

              <h2>logo design</h2>

              <p>The word associations helped me brainstorm potential names, and
                the word “brio” stood out as a unique noun, meaning: vigor or vivacity of style
                or performance; energy; spirit; liveliness.</p>
              <p>Brio is a short, simple word that also feels bright and fresh, so I started to
                sketch out logo variations with a modern feel.</p>

            <div class="logo-test">

              <h3>testing</h3>
              <p>I narrowed down the logo concepts to two potential
                options that felt modern and honest, and I received
                feedback from users.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="test-quotes">

              <p>While people liked the elegance and simplicity of the top

              <p class="quote">“I liked the rays from the O - it reminds me of waking up to
                coffee and starting my day in a positive way.”</p>

                  <h2>lesson learned:</h2>
                  <p>Initially, I selected a cerulean blue for Brazil (before moving
                    to the current golden yellow) thinking blue would look nice
                    with purple and red.
                  <p>However, I quickly realized that blue does not seem fitting
                    for Brazil, nor for the flavor of that coffee roast. User
                    testing of the coffee bag mockups quickly confirmed that
                    blue felt inappropriate, and yellow provides greater overall
                    synergy.</p>

              <p>While researching artisanal coffee brands, I took note of
                how competitors market their product through packaging.
                Since Brio offers coffee beans from different regions
                around the globe, I wanted each coffee roast’s bag to be
                differentiated by that region, either by color, images, or
                both.</p>

              <h2>wireframes</h2>
              <p>Now with my branding established, I quickly sketched
                wireframes of the home page to get a sense of the site’s
                general layout. I then took my hand sketches into Sketch,
                to create desktop and mobile wireframes. This helped me
                think about how to prioritize information for the user, and
                how the layout will adapt to smaller screens.</p>
              <p>For larger screen/browser sizes, I placed the products side-
                by-side. Consumers I spoke to liked having the products in
                a row for equal comparison. As the website continues to
                develop, users will be able to click on the bag to learn more
                about that roast and make a purchase.</p>

              <p>I used these wireframes and my branding decisions to create mockups,

                    <li>In the first draft, the Brazil bag still uses the color blue,

                    <li>Users felt that the photos towards the bottom of
                      the home page clashed with the illustration at the top. Thus,
                      I created new illustrations, which users feel provide much
                      more brand coherence.</li>

              <p>My favorite and most rewarding part of this project was the development
                phase, which brought all of my user research, designs, and testing to life.
                In addition to media queries, I used CSS Grid to give Brio’s home page a
                structure that seamlessly adjusts to the user’s screen size.</p>

              <p>My goal with Brio Coffee was to create a brand that reflected their artistry,
                attention to detail, love for the environment, and passion for coffee. The
                research I conducted, along with user testing throughout the design
                process helped me achieve a brand identity that users found to be
                friendly, modern, and committed.</p>
              <p>I was then able to showcase Brio Coffee as a viable artisan coffee roaster,
                by creating and coding their home page. I utilized media queries and
                learned how to implement CSS Grid in order to develop a site that is fully
                responsive across all devices. In the near future, I hope to continue
                developing Brio’s site, by adding in their shop page for consumers to easily
                and securely purchase Brio coffee.</p>
