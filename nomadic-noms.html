              <h2>the problem</h2>

              <img src="images/noms/pizza.png" alt="pizza" class="illustration-pizza">

              <p>Food trucks are increasingly trendy in large cities, popping up on street
                corners, behind bars, and at music festivals to provide unique, exotic, and
                authentic culinary styles. Locals and visitors all want to be in-the-know of
                these trendy food options within their city.</p>

              <p>However, since food trucks are mobile and sometimes change locations/
                hours, people want a way to discover which trucks are nearby and then
                view the food truck’s hours and menus, before making the trek out to one.
                In an age where everything is at the tips of our fingers, hungry folks want
                to avoid the line, pre-order their food, and pay through their phone.</p>

              <img src="images/noms/truck.png" alt="food truck" class="illustration-truck">

              <h2>the solution</h2>

              <p>The focus of this project was to listen to and understand users’ needs and
                desires when they search for local eateries. I used this research to design
                an app that was fun in appearance, but that more importantly was easy to
                use, and trustworthy so that users take advantage of the convenience of
                paying through the app.</p>

          </section>

          <section class="user-surveys">

              <h2>audience - user surveys</h2>

              <p>In order to better understand the users, their habits,
                and their expectations, I conducted user surveys to gather data
                that could inform my design decisions.</p>

              <p>My initial assumptions were that the audience would be a
                younger crowd, single, in their twenties, looking for hot
                new eateries to venture to with friends. I opened the
                survey to all demographics though, to make sure all
                potential users were included.</p>

              <img src="images/noms/clipboard.png" alt="user surveys" class="illustration-clipboard">
              <p>Key survey question topics:</p>
              <p>- General phone use</p>
              <p>- Online payment habits</p>
              <p>- Eating out habits</p>

              <h3>most important discoveries</h3>
              <div class="discoveries">

                  <p>- 89%</p>
                  <p>of respondents use maps/navigation apps on their phones</p>

                  <p>- 78%</p>
                  <p>currently use mobile banking and/or shopping apps</p>

                  <p>- 78%</p>
                  <p>use social media logins to sign-up for apps</p>

                  <p>- 56%</p>
                  <p>use apps to explore a new city when they travel</p>

                  <p>- 67%</p>
                  <p>prefer mobile/online banking and shopping</p>

                  <p>- 67%</p>
                  <p>feel comfortable storing their credit/debit card information within an app account - only if they can trust the app</p>

                  <p>- 84%</p>
                  <p>go out for food at least once a week</p>

                  <p>- 56%</p>
                  <p>will possibly leave a review for an extremely positive or negative food truck</p>

                  <p>* I also learned that my demographic assumptions were too narrow.
                    Users of all ages are interested in trying out food trucks. People are likely
                    to go with co-workers or take their young kids to explore food trucks, so I
                    made sure to identify these findings in my user personas.</p>

              <p>After collecting and analyzing the survey data, I conducted follow-up
                interviews with three users to gain more insight into their frustrations with
                current apps, and their motivations and goals with a new app.</p>

              <p>In order to gain knowledge of the market and what apps are currently
                available for users, I completed an extensive competitive analysis, noting
                their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement:</p>

                  <h4>weaknesses</h4>
                  <p>-  The app does not tag/categorize food trucks, such as into cuisine type, budget-friendly, etc.</p>
                  <p>-  The only option is to login with Facebook (no separate username/password)</p>
                  <p>-  No map view option, only a list view</p>
                  <p>-  Only ‘open’ locations are listed, as opposed to showing all locations for the user’s future reference</p>

                  <p>-  Give users the option to create an account either via a username/password or through social media</p>
                  <p>-  Include a map view and a list view of local trucks</p>
                  <p>-  Allow users to save favorites and a history of their past transactions</p>
                  <p>-  Within the truck details, list any coupons, sales, happy hours, etc.</p>

              <p>Understanding the user and competitors helped
                inform my branding goals and decisions. I created
                mind-maps and word associations to brainstorm the
                brand’s personality, positioning, and identity.</p>
              <p>The goal with Nomadic Noms’ branding is to create
                this sense of joy and creativity, while still being a
                professional, trustworthy app. The idea of creativity
                is important because often the food options at food
                trucks are innovative.</p>

              <img src="images/noms/food-truck-mind-map.png" alt="Food Truck Mind Map" class="food-truck-mind-map">

              <h2>logo design</h2>
              <p>The word associations helped me brainstorm potiential names, which I
                narrowed down, and sketched out as logos.</p>

              <img src="images/noms/logo-sketches.png" alt="Logo Sketches" class="logo-sketches">

              <h3>name</h3>
              <p>The name Nomadic Noms was chosen because of its playful
                repetition of “Nom Nom” and its suggestion of finding food
                that moves around. I then recreated the Nomadic Noms
                sketches using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

              <h3>testing</h3>
              <p>I presented these options to potential users and received
                helpful feedback: With a bit more modification, the middle
                option was preferred as most appropriate for the brand
                identity. It can be easily read at a mobile size and the map
                pin can be used as an icon.</p>

              <h2>typography</h2>
              <p>Roboto is the primary typeface for Nomadic Noms,
                because this is an Android app. It must be used with a
                style of “regular” for standard text, or “medium” when a
                hierarchy is needed with certain headings.</p>

              <p>Roboto Medium</p>
              <p>Roboto Regular</p>

              <p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</p>

              <img src="images/noms/purple-circle.png" alt="Secondary Purple" class="color">
              <p>#AB47BC</p>

              <p>Orange is associated with happiness,
                joy, creativity, and enthusiasm. It is
                stimulating and is supposed to
                increase hunger, decision-making, and
                confidence.</p>

                <p>Fuchsia is a bright hue of purple that
                  embodies energy and creativity. </p>

              <h2>user stories &amp; user flows</h2>

              <p>Now that I had an understanding of the users’ goals, I wrote out user
                stories to outline the major tasks they hope to achieve.</p>

              <p class="quote">As a user, I want to…</p>

              <p>- <span class="bold-text">rate and review a food truck</span> and view other ratings and reviews.</p>

              <p>These user stories were then broken down into step-by-step user flows
                that show how users interact with Nomadic Noms in order to complete
                their task.</p>

              <h2>user testing focused on:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>ease-of-use</li>
                <li>minimizing steps</li>
                <li>visual coherence</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>A / B preference test:</h3>
              <h4>map view - selecting a food truck</h4>
              <p>An important interaction for this app is what happens
                when the user clicks a certain pin on the map view to
                find out more details about that food truck.</p>

              <p>I ran a preference test to find out which screen users
                found more informative.</p>

              <p><span class="bold-text">Option B</span> was preferred by <span class="bold-text">75%</span> of test participants, who also provided some reasons for choosing this layout:</p>

              <ul class="quote">
                <li>“Simpler, doesn't use up so much of the map space. I would assume I can tap, or drag up, on the white bar to see a full profile.”</li>
                <li>“So i can continue navigating the map unblocked”</li>
                <li>“Address is easy to see”</li>
              </ul>

              <p>I <span class="bold-text">listened</span> to the users and decided to go with screen B, after altering a few details on the design.</p>

              <img src="images/noms/tests/select-truck-test1.png" alt="Select a Truck Screen A" class="test-v1">
              <img src="images/noms/tests/select-truck-test2.png" alt="Select a Truck Screen B" class="test-v2">

              <p class="bold-text">A</p>
              <p class="bold-text">B</p>

              <h3>A / B preference tests:</h3>
              <h4>adding menu items to shopping cart</h4>
              <p>Being able to clickly add or remove food items to your
                order and change the quantity should be quick and
                intuitive!</p>

              <p>On the food truck menu, should users be able to check off
                multiple items to their shopping cart at once, or add them
                one at a time with a modal window to focus on that item?</p>

              <p>I ran a preference test to find out which process users
                found more convenient.</p>

              <p class="bold-text">A</p>
              <p class="bold-text">B</p>

              <img src="images/noms/tests/add-item-1a.png" alt="Add an Item A" class="test2-v1">
              <img src="images/noms/tests/add-item-1b.png" alt="Add an Item B" class="test2-v2">

              <p class="bold-text">51.28%</p>
              <p class="bold-text">48.72%</p>

              <ul>
                <li>“I like that I could control the quantity for multiple items at
                  once and see the total.”</li>
                <li>“I would prefer to see both options at checkout,
                  this elimates a step on your part and you can can see all you items
                  right away.”</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>“I'm able to focus on changing the quantity and other
                  options before moving onto the next step. It's clearer.”</li>
                <li>“The other option didn't focus on the previously selected
                  item which made it confusing.”</li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="bold-text">Too close to call!</h4>
              <p>Users were split on this test, so I took their feedback from
                both options to improve the menu and ordering process.</p>
              <p>I also learned that this test did not provide users with
                enough details of the full ordering process. In my follow-up
                test, I showed more steps so that users were truly
                understanding the amount of clicks in the navigation.</p>

              <h3>follow-up test:</h3>
              <h4>adding menu items to shopping cart</h4>

              <p class="bold-text">A</p>
              <p class="bold-text">B</p>

              <img src="images/noms/tests/add-item-2a.png" alt="Add an Item A" class="test3-v1">
              <img src="images/noms/tests/add-item-2b.png" alt="Add an Item B" class="test3-v2">

              <p class="bold-text">73.91%</p>
              <p class="bold-text">26.09%</p>

              <p><span class="bold-text">Option A</span> was preferred by <span class="bold-text">73.91%<span> of test participants:

              <p class="quote">“Seems easier to follow than the 4 screens of the other option. I understand what's going on and it's visually appealing.”</p>
              <p class="quote">“easier to use, [I] like less steps, [I] like the images from the very beginning”</p>

              <h3>lessons learned</h3>
              <p>This test was valuable beyond it’s design and navigation
                aspects. It taught me how important it is to clearly present
                the options to users, how to implement their feedback, and
                the importance of continuing to listen to the user
                throughout the design process.</p>

          <section class="prototype">

              <h2>prototype</h2>
              <p>I still needed users to actually click through and test out
                the navigation to make sure they can complete tasks. I
                used InVision to create a prototype, and watched as users
                completed certain tasks through their phone.</p>
              <p>The users provided feedback such as making certain
                buttons more obvious, and toning down the bright colors
                on certain screens.</p>
              <p>I made some adjustments, and after final user testing,
                users stated that the end result is an app that is user-
                friendly, easy-to-use, trustworthy, and fun.</p>

          <section class="conclusion">

              <h2>conclusion</h2>
              <p>My goal with Nomadic Noms was to create a mobile app
                that could introduce users to unique food options in their
                city, or a city they are visiting, and offer the convenience of
                paying through the app.</p>
              <p>The research I conducted through competitive analysis,
                user surveys, and testing was critical throughout the design
                process to ensure the design was meeting the needs of the
                user. Tasks such as selecting food from the menu, paying
                for the order, and creating an account were made more
                efficient and now provide a positive user experience.</p>
              <p>In considering further development of the current minimal
                viable product, I would like to work with the food trucks to
                feature their specials, happy hours, discounts, and other
                special initiatives that would draw users to continue using
                Nomadic Noms.</p>
