          <h2 class="problem">the problem</h2>

          <img src="images/noms/pizza.png" alt="pizza" class="illustration-pizza">

          <div class="problem-text">

              <p>Food trucks are increasingly trendy in large cities, popping up on street
                corners, behind bars, and at music festivals to provide unique, exotic, and
                authentic culinary styles. Locals and visitors all want to be in-the-know of
                these trendy food options within their city.</p>

              <p>However, since food trucks are mobile and sometimes change locations/
                hours, people want a way to discover which trucks are nearby and then
                view the food truck’s hours and menus, before making the trek out to one.
                In an age where everything is at the tips of our fingers, hungry folks want
                to avoid the line, pre-order their food, and pay through their phone.</p>

          </div>

          <img src="images/noms/truck.png" alt="food truck" class="illustration-truck">

          <h2 class="solution">the solution</h2>

          <p class="solution-text">The focus of this project was to listen to and understand users’ needs and
            desires when they search for local eateries. I used this research to design
            an app that was fun in appearance, but that more importantly was easy to
            use, and trustworthy so that users take advantage of the convenience of
            paying through the app.</p>


          <div class="user-surveys">

              <h2>audience - user surveys</h2>

              <p>In order to better understand the users, their habits,
                and their expectations, I conducted user surveys to gather data
                that could inform my design decisions.</p>

              <p>My initial assumptions were that the audience would be a
                younger crowd, single, in their twenties, looking for hot
                new eateries to venture to with friends. I opened the
                survey to all demographics though, to make sure all
                potential users were included.</p>

          </div>

          <img src="images/noms/clipboard.png" alt="user surveys" class="illustration-clipboard">

          <div class="survey-topics">
              <h4>Key survey question topics:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>General phone use</li>
                <li>Online payment habits</li>
                <li>Eating out habits</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="discoveries">most important discoveries</h3>

          <ul class="discoveries-list">

              <li><span class="bold-text">89%</span> of respondents use maps/navigation apps on their phones</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">78%</span> currently use mobile banking and/or shopping apps</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">78%</span> use social media logins to sign-up for apps</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">56%</span> use apps to explore a new city when they travel</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">67%</span> prefer mobile/online banking and shopping</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">67%</span> feel comfortable storing their credit/debit card information within an app account - only if they can trust the app</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">84%</span> go out for food at least once a week</li>

              <li><span class="bold-text">56%</span> will possibly leave a review for an extremely positive or negative food truck</li>

          </ul>

          <p class="surveys-lesson"><span class="bold-text">* I also learned</span> that my demographic assumptions were too narrow.
                Users of all ages are interested in trying out food trucks. People are likely
                to go with co-workers or take their young kids to explore food trucks, so I
                made sure to identify these findings in my user personas.</p>

              <p>After collecting and analyzing the survey data, I conducted follow-up

                current apps, and their motivations and goals with a new app.</p>

              <p>Understanding the user and competitors helped
                inform my branding goals and decisions. I created
                mind-maps and word associations to brainstorm the
                brand’s personality, positioning, and identity.</p>
              <p>The goal with Nomadic Noms’ branding is to create
                this sense of joy and creativity, while still being a
                professional, trustworthy app. The idea of creativity
                is important because often the food options at food
                trucks are innovative.</p>

                that moves around. I then recreated the Nomadic Noms

                used InVision to create a prototype, and watched as users
                completed certain tasks through their phone.</p>
              <p>The users provided feedback such as making certain
                buttons more obvious, and toning down the bright colors
                on certain screens.</p>
              <p>I made some adjustments, and after final user testing,
                users stated that the end result is an app that is user-

              <h2>conclusion</h2>
              <p>My goal with Nomadic Noms was to create a mobile app
                that could introduce users to unique food options in their
                city, or a city they are visiting, and offer the convenience of
                paying through the app.</p>
              <p>The research I conducted through competitive analysis,
                user surveys, and testing was critical throughout the design
                process to ensure the design was meeting the needs of the
                user. Tasks such as selecting food from the menu, paying
                for the order, and creating an account were made more
                efficient and now provide a positive user experience.</p>
              <p>In considering further development of the current minimal
                viable product, I would like to work with the food trucks to
                feature their specials, happy hours, discounts, and other
                special initiatives that would draw users to continue using
                Nomadic Noms.</p>
